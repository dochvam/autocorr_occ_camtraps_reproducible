It contains the following fields:

-   Species - the scientific name of the modeled species

-   ModType - whether the parameteter comes from a clustered model, an SOM with 1-day windows, or an SOM with 10-day windows

-   Submodel - whether the parameter is in the detection or occupancy submodel

-   Param - the name of the parameter
