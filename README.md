Reproducing the simulation study investigating the impact of autocorrelated camera trap detections on occupancy models by Goldstein et al.

The files in this repository are organized into the following directories:

-   code_casestudy - contains code files for running the case study with SnapshotUSA detection histories

-   code_helper - contains code files not meant to be called directly, which load in helper functions for use in simulations and

-   code_simulations - contains scripts to execute the four simulation studies and to summarize and visualize the results of those simulations

-   input_data - contains the SnapshotUSA detection histories used in the case study

-   intermediate - catches intermediate files created during code execution, and is empty to begin with.

-   plots - contains the data visualizations in the manuscript and supplemental materials

-   results_tables - contains the results output by the original simulation and case studies, for use without re-running all analyses

Each subdirectory contains a README.md file detailing the code and data files contained.
